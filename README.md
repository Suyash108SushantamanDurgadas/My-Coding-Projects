# My Coding Projects

Welcome to **My Coding Projects** – a personal collection of mini programs, practice files, and logic-based experiments built as part of my programming journey.

## What's Inside?

This repository includes:

- C, C++ code files
- Pattern printing programs
- College practicals and assignments
- Code logic experiments from various online/offline resources
- Electronics + code snippets (wherever relevant)
